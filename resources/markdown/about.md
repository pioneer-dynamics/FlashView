# About Us

Hi ðŸ‘‹! I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathew-paret-b6b96041" target="_blank">Mathew</a>, the creator of {CONFIG:app.name}. It all started when a new contractor joined our company and we had to share their VPN credentials. At first we used third party services that existed and we were happy with it. At some point we realised that there was a better way to do this. The service we used didn't provide end-to-end encryption and that was a concern. It then turned to an idea and then to the product you see now! I discussed this with fellow technology enthusiasts and found that the usecases are much more than I initially anticipated.

Most applications I've built so far are OpenSource and true to the roots we are committed to keeping {CONFIG:app.name} <a href="https://github.com/pioneer-dynamics/FlashView" targe="_blank">OpenSource</a> too. Checkout our other projects on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pioneer-dynamics/repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

If you'd like to reachout, share your thoughts or ideas you can reach me at mathew@pioneerdynamics.com.au.

Here's to secure sharing,

Mathew
